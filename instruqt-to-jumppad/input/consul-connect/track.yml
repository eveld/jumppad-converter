title: Getting started with Consul Connect
teaser: Learn the basics of Consul Connect
description: |-
  In this hands-on lab, you'll start two services and connect them over a TLS encrypted proxy with Consul Connect. Integrating applications with Consul Connect is as easy as talking to a port on localhost.

  The frontend will be a demo dashboard web application that displays a number. The backend will be a counting service that serves a JSON feed with a constantly incrementing number.

  ![Connect](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e5bd5b1d97fde97ac429cf28f123f28a81000f52/911cf/img/consul/connect-getting-started/consul_connect_demo_service_flow.png)

  The frontend uses websockets to update its user interface every few seconds with fresh data from the backend counting service.

  You'll spend most of your time executing commands against our demo applications (dashboard and counting), but Consul works to help services discover each other and connect through encrypted proxies.

  We've configured Consul for you and started a single agent, so it's ready to go. Let's get started!
