**Start the counting service**, specifying PORT as an environment variable.

---

You can do this by running the following command in the **Terminal** tab:

```
PORT=9003 counting-service
```

You can view the output of the counting service in the **Counting** tab at the top of the screen.
It's a simple JSON API that returns a number.

If you refresh the Consul Web UI in the **Consul UI** tab, you'll notice that the counting service now shows as healthy.
