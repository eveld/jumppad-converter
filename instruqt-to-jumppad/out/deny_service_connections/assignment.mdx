**Create an intention** that **denies all** communication between all services.

---

This is achieved be creating an intention from *** (All Services)** to *** (All Services)** with a value of **deny**.

You can optionally add a description such as "Deny all communication by default".

Then save the newly created intention.

Since existing proxies will not be terminated when a deny rule is created, we must restart the dashboard-service.

Restart it by typing

```
killall dashboard-service
```

in the Terminal tab. We will then restart it for you.

If you look at the **Dashboard** and you will see that it cannot reach the backend counting-service because all connections are denied.
