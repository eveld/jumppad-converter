**Now start the dashboard service**, specifying PORT as an environment variable as in the previous challenge.

---

Consul is configured to look for the **dashboard-service** on port **9002**.
The configuration for this service is located at `/etc/consul.d/dashboard.json`.

You can do this by running the following command in the **Terminal** tab:

```
PORT=9002 dashboard-service
```

When started correctly, you can view the demo dashboard application in the **Dashboard** tab.
And the health check will return alive in the **Consul UI** tab.
