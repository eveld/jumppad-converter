**Add an intention that allows the dashboard service to connect to the counting service**.

---

You can do this by selecting **dashboard** in the first pulldown and **counting** in the second pulldown. Then selecting **allow** below. Optionally adding a description.

Then save the new intention.

Finally, view the **Dashboard** tab which will automatically discover the new connection (no refresh is needed for this websockets-driven application). It should not take more than a few seconds.

You will not need to restart any services since intentions which allow connectivity will take effect dynamically.
