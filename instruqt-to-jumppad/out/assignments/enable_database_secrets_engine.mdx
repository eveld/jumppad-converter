The Database secrets engine generates credentials dynamically for various databases.  In this track, we are using an instance of MySQL that is running on the same VM as the Vault server itself.

The Database credentials are time-bound and are automatically revoked when the Vault lease expires. The credentials can also be revoked at any time.

All secrets engines must be enabled before they can be used. Check which secrets engines are currently enabled.
```
vault secrets list
```

Note that the Database secrets engine is not enabled. Please enable it at the path "lob_a/workshop/database".
```
vault secrets enable -path=lob_a/workshop/database database
```

If you like, you can login to the Vault UI with the Vault token `root` and see that the database secrets engine has been enabled.
